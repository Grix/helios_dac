SDK for Helios Laser DAC class

Dependencies:
Libusb 1.0 (GNU Lesser General Public License, see libusb.h)

Standard: C++14
git repo: https://github.com/Grix/helios_dac.git

BASIC USAGE:
1.	Call OpenDevices() to open devices, returns number of available devices.
2.	To send a frame to the DAC, first call GetStatus(). The status should be polled until it returns ready.
	If the function returns ready (1), then you can call WriteFrame*().
3.  To stop output, use Stop(). To restart output you must send a new frame as described above.
4.	When the DAC is no longer needed, destroy the instance (destructors will free everything and close the connection)

More more information on all functions, see their declarations below.

When the DAC receives its first frame, it starts outputting it. When a second frame is sent to
the DAC while the first frame is being played, the second frame is stored in the DACs memory until the first frame
finishes playback, at which point the second, buffered frame will start playing. If the DAC finished playback of a frame
without having received and buffered a second frame, it will by default loop the first frame until a new frame is
received (but the flag HELIOS_FLAG_SINGLE_MODE will make it stop playback instead).
The GetStatus() function actually checks whether or not the buffer on the DAC is empty or full. If it is full, the DAC
cannot receive a new frame until the currently playing frame finishes, freeing up the buffer. This is not applicable
on IDN network DACs, they will always be ready to receive a new frame, but by default the GetStatus still simulates 
the time it would take for the IDN DAC to play the frame, to stay backwards compatible with programs that depend on
GetStatus() for timing purposes.
