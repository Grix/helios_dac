Helios Laser DAC SDK shared library, HEADER

Dependencies:
Libusb 1.0 (GNU Lesser General Public License, see libusb.h)
HeliosDAC.cpp/h and its dependencies in the idn folder

Standard: C++14

This is the shared library extension of the Helios DAC SDK, used to produce a dynamic library file like .dll, .so or .dylib. 
This allows you to call the code from other languages than C++.
If such a file is not neccessary, you can simply use HeliosDAC.cpp/.h and the files in the idn subfolder directly in your 
source code, with no additional files or build steps needed.

BASIC USAGE:
1.	Call OpenDevices() to open devices, returns number of available devices.
2.	To send a new frame, first call GetStatus(). If the function returns ready (1),then you can call WriteFrame*().
	The status should be polled until it returns ready. It can and sometimes will fail to return ready on the first try.
3.  To stop output, use Stop(). To restart output you must send a new frame as described above.
4.	When the DAC is no longer needed, free it using CloseDevices()

More more information on all functions, see their declarations below. 
Unless otherwise specified, functions return a negative error code on failure.

The DAC is double-buffered. When it receives its first frame, it starts outputting it. When a second frame is sent to
the DAC while the first frame is being played, the second frame is stored in the DACs memory until the first frame
finishes playback, at which point the second, buffered frame will start playing. If the DAC finished playback of a frame
without having received and buffered a second frame, it will by default loop the first frame until a new frame is
received (but the flag HELIOS_FLAG_SINGLE_MODE will make it stop playback instead).
The GetStatus() function actually checks whether or not the buffer on the DAC is empty or full. If it is full, the DAC
cannot receive a new frame until the currently playing frame finishes, freeing up the buffer. This is not applicable
on IDN network DACs, they will always be ready to receive a new frame, but by default the GetStatus still simulates 
the time it would take for the IDN DAC to play the frame, to stay backwards compatible with programs that depend on
GetStatus() for timing purposes.

// Writes and outputs a frame to the speficied dac, with the light-weight frame structure backwards compatible with the old Helios DAC library.
// WriteFrame() uses the lightweight point structure designed for the original Helios DAC.
// WriteFrameHighResolution() uses a higher resolution point structure supported by newer DAC models. If unsure, this one is recommended.
// WriteFrameExtended() has additional optional channels and a higher resolution point structure supported by newer DAC models.
// It is safe to call any of these functions even for DACs that don't support higher resolution data. In that case the data will automatically be converted (though at a slight performance cost).
// dacNum: dac number (0 to n where n+1 is the return value from OpenDevices() )
