This is the shared library extension of the Helios DAC SDK, used to produce a library file for dynamic linking, like .dll, .so or .dylib. It has compatibility functions with the EzAudDac functions. 
If dynamic linking is not neccessary, you can simply use the files in the parent folder (HeliosDAC.cpp, HeliosDAC.h and the source files in the idn folder) directly in your source code, with no additional files or build steps needed.

NB: These libraries depend on libusb. In addition to HeliosLaserDAC.dll/dylib/so you also need libusb-1.0.dll/dylib/so in the same folder, or installed on the computer some other way. You can find these files in the ../libusb_bin folder.

BASIC USAGE:
1.	Call OpenDevices()  to open devices, returns number of available devices.
2.	To send a new frame, first call GetStatus(). If the function returns ready, (1), then you can call WriteFrame\*().
	The status should be polled until it returns ready. It can and sometimes will fail to return ready on the first try.
3.  To stop output, use Stop(). To restart output you must send a new frame as described above.
4.	When the DAC is no longer needed, free it using CloseDevices().

When the DAC receives its first frame, it starts outputting it. When a second frame is sent to
the DAC while the first frame is being played, the second frame is stored in the DACs memory until the first frame
finishes playback, at which point the second, buffered frame will start playing. If the DAC finished playback of a frame
without having received and buffered a second frame, it will by default loop the first frame until a new frame is
received (but the flag HELIOS_FLAG_SINGLE_MODE will make it stop playback instead).
The GetStatus() function actually checks whether or not the buffer on the DAC is empty or full. If it is full, the DAC
cannot receive a new frame until the currently playing frame finishes, freeing up the buffer.

**NEW**: As of October 2024, the C++ SDK has been updated to include IDN (network) support. This means that if you implement/update the Helios library in your application, it will also seamlessly enable support for any other network DAC using the IDN protocol, including the Helios OpenIDN adapter, StageMate ISP, and upcoming Helios products. This also enables more capabilities such as higher resolution and more data channels. This is reflected by the choice of multiple WriteFrame\*() functions, such as WriteFrameHighResolution() and WriteFrameExtended(). 
The original WriteFrame() with 12-bit XY resolution and 8-bit RGBI channels have been preserved for backwards compatibility and a light-weight alternative, but for new or updated applications, it is recommended to choose at least WriteFrameHighResolution() instead. It gives you the most common channels, XY+RGB, with 16-bit resolution each. It is safe to call this function even if the DAC in use does not support these resolutions, the library will automatically convert the data.
