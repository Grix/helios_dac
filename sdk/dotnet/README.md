NB: The .NET library for the Helios DAC is currently in beta. It should in theory work on all platforms supporting Libusb, but it has only been tested on Win64 on .NET 6.0.
ALSO: The .NET library has not been updated with support for IDN (network DACs), only Helios USB.

**If you experience problems or want to use IDN too, consider using the C++ library and call the dll from C# using interop instead.**
