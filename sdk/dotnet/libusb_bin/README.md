The Helios libraries depend on libusb. Library binaries are included here for convenience, but you can also acquire them from Libusb directly: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/libusb-1.0.26/

Or on Linux, you should install via package manager: *sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev*
