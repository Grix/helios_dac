/*
Driver API for Helios Laser DAC class, HEADER
By Gitle Mikkelsen
gitlem@gmail.com

Dependencies:
Libusb 1.0 (GNU Lesser General Public License, see libusb.h)

Standard: C++14
git repo: https://github.com/Grix/helios_dac.git

BASIC USAGE:
1.	Call OpenDevices() to open devices, returns number of available devices.
2.	To send a new frame, first call GetStatus(). If the function returns ready (1), 
	then you can call WriteFrame(). The status should be polled until it returns ready. 
	It can and sometimes will fail to return ready on the first try.
3.  To stop output, use Stop(). To restart output you must send a new frame as described above.
4.	When the DAC is no longer needed, destroy the instance (destructors will free everything and close the connection)
